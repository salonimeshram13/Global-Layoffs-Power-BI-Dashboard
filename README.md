# Global-Layoffs-Power-BI-Dashboard
The Layoffs Analysis project revolves around creating an interactive Power BI dashboard using the dataset sourced from Kaggle that encapsulates layoffs data from year 2020 to 2023. 
The objective is to build a visually engaging and insightful dashboard to analyze and present key metrics related to layoffs across industries, company sizes, regions, and reasons 
for workforce reductions.


## About Dataset:
Tech firms around the globe are fighting the economic slowdown. The slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks and strong dollars overseas are hinting towards 
possible recession and tech firms have started laying employees off. This economic slowdown has made many Tech Giants fire their employees. 
This dataset was made with the hope to enable Kaggle community to look into analyzing recent tech turmoil and discover useful insights.

The data availability is from when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic i.e. 11 March 2020 to present (16 October 2023).

## The project will involve the following steps:

- #### Data Preparation and Cleaning:
Importing the dataset into Power BI and performing necessary data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, formatting data types, and ensuring data consistency to enable accurate analysis.

- #### Dashboard Design:
Designing an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard interface within Power BI. This involves creating various visualizations (e.g., bar charts, cards, pie charts, geographical maps) that dynamically represent the distribution and trends of layoffs based on different parameters like industry types, geographic locations, companies.

- #### Interactive Features:
Implementing interactive features within the dashboard, such as filters, slicers, and drill-down options, to allow users to explore the data according to their specific interests. This will enable users to interactively delve deeper into specific segments or categories of layoffs.




<br><br><br>The primary goal of this Power BI dashboard project is to present a comprehensive and interactive visual representation of layoffs data in 2022. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, 
the project aims to provide stakeholders with a valuable tool for understanding, exploring, and 
gaining insights into the dynamics of layoffs across industries, geographical regions, and other relevant parameters.
